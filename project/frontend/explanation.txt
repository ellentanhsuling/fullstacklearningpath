The separation between src and public folders follows a common frontend development pattern:

public folder:

Contains files that are served directly to the browser
index.html is the entry point that users first access
Files here are static and don't need processing
src folder:

Contains source code that may need processing/compilation
styles.css might be preprocessed (like SASS to CSS)
app.js might be bundled, minified, or transformed
Source files that developers work with directly
This structure helps organize:

What the browser sees directly (public)
What developers work on (src)
What needs to be processed before production
It's particularly useful when using build tools or when the project grows larger.
